<h3>About project</h3>
<a>This is a test work. This project is an API with a database that receives and 
caches data from several sources every 10 seconds in order to then provide averaged data to the user.
This is my first hands-on experience with FastAPI, MongoDB and Celery, 
so a lot of things may not be quite right, but they work.
